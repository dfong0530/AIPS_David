### What is does

AIPS is an Amazon Inventory Processing System. In the project we created a software to look for discounted amazon products and list them on Ebay.

I worked with my team on that portion, but I also made personal contributions to build off my project in this repository.

The Amazon deals we find are posted on discord, I worked on a bot to monitor the channel and 

when it finds products with a value greater than the minimum threshold it sends us a text message.


We also, find various websites that give coupons, we used pupeteer to gather coupons in the /coupons_generator.


I also, created a bot with py-puputeer to message a list of usernames through direct message to market to people about products we found.
