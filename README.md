# AIPS_DAvid



### What is does

AIPS is an Amazon Inventory Processing System. In the project we created a software to look for discounted amazon products and list them on Ebay.

I worked with my team on that portion, but I also made personal contributions to build off my project in this repository.

The Amazon deals we find are posted on discord, I worked on a bot to monitor the channel and 

when it finds products with a value greater than the minimum threshold it sends us a text message.


I also, created a bot with py-pupeteer to message a list of usernames through direct message to market to peoopel about proudcts we found.
